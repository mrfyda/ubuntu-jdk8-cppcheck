### Alpine with GCH and Oracle JDK 8

This image is based on Alpine Linux image.
Contains both GHC with a cabal installation as [base image](https://github.com/mitchty/alpine-linux-ghc-bootstrap) from [mitchty](https://github.com/mitchty).
Then [Oracle JDK 8](https://github.com/frol/docker-alpine-oraclejdk8) was added from the work of [frol](https://github.com/frol).

All the installations are clean and contain only the necessary parts.
